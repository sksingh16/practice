1.Explain how and why java came into existence.
Ans1. Java was basically developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems. Java is platform independent and we can run java on any platform  ,  also they want to make such
language which is small , robust , platform independent because languages like c is not platform independent 

2.State the difference between JVM,JDK & JRE.
Ans2.  Lets start with the abbrevations
		JVM - Java Virtual Machine  ,  JDK - Java Development Kit   ,  JRE - Java Runtime Environment
The jre is set of softwre tools designed for runnning software other . Every user need this to run the java program.
The jvm provide its users with a platform independent way for executing the java codes , It consiste of libraries and frameworks.
Th jdk consists of various tools rquired for writing the java programs. Provides environment to execute the java source code.

3.Explain why is java portable.
Ans3.java is portable because it can compile a java code which will give us the byte code and then we can run that code with java virtual machine  

4.State the differece in platform independent vs platform dependent with examples.
Ans4. In platform independent -->there is great scope as there are no limitations 
            #the maintainence of these is much easier , 
            #it means that the applications can run in a diverse operating systems.
EXAMPLE OF THIS IS JAVA . 

Platform dpependent --> usuaully refers to applications that run under only a single operationg systems in one series of computers.
        #This means software will functions in one paticular platform it will not run on other operating systems.
EXAMPLE OF THIS IS C++ . 


5.Explain thr difference between interpretation vs compilation and how is the performance different .
Ans5. Compiled language -->It follows at least two levels to get from source code to execution. 
       #A compiled language is converted into machine code so that the processor can execute it.
       #In a compiled language, the code can be executed by the CPU.
	
Interpreted language --> It follows one step to get from source code to execution.
	#The interpreted programs run slower than the compiled program.
	#In this languages, the program cannot be compiled, it is interpreted.
	#This language delivers slower performance.

6.What is backward compatibility and does java support this feature.
Ans6. Backward compatibility in java is a property which allows older API usages to function without breaking their existing implenetations when API is modified . Yes Java support this.

7. State the difference between float and double.
Ans7.The main difference between float and double 
      #Size :- Float is of size 32 bits while double is of size 64 bits.
      #Precision :- Float can allow only 7 bits of precision ,But double allow almost double the nuber of bits for the exponent
      #Wrapper Class :- Both float abd double are primitive types . This means these are having there own Wrapper class .The wrapper class for the float is java.lang.Float
                        while the Wrapper class for the double is java.lang.Double .  

8. List all the operators that Java support.
Ans8. #Arithmetic Operators.
      #Bitwise Operators.
      #Relational Operators.
      #Logical Operators.
      #Unary Operators.
      #Assignment Operators.


9. Write a program to check whether a number is negative, positive or zero.

        }
        if(a==0)

10.Write a program to find maximum between three numbers using conditional
operator.

       int c  = 3;
       int max ;
       
       max = (a > b)?((a > c)?a:c) : ((b > c)? b:c);
    System.out.println(max);
        
        
    }
